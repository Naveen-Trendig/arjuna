Handling **Information Exchange Formats**
=========================================

**Text**, **JSON**, **YAML**, **XML** and **HTML** are widely used and handled formats for information exchange and hence test automation also needs basic to advanced facilities with these formats.

Accordingly, parsing these formats is a very common need that test automation engineers need to cater to.

Arjuna provides its own objects to easy handle these content types in its helper classes in Tester Programming Interface. The corresponding objects are also returned by its other objects.
